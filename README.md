#Objectives:
We aim to create a lively and interactive dashboard to give a fully-functional overview of the car's sales performance. The dashboard will provide visualizations to enable users to monitor sales metrics, identify trends, and make informed decisions.

#Key features of the dashboard may include:

- Sales Overview: A high-level summary of sales performance, including total revenue, total units sold, and average order value. This section may also include a comparison with previous periods or targets.

- Sales by Region: A geographical representation of sales data, showcasing sales performance across different regions or territories. This can be presented using interactive maps, allowing users to drill down into specific regions for more detailed insights.

- Filter on different categories: Brand name, Model, Top speed, Age, and many more...
